1) Main Concepts Applied: This code uses HTML form elements to create a maintenance request form, including text input, dropdown selection, radio buttons for issue type, text areas for additional information, and styling with inline CSS for background colors.

2) New Skills or Knowledge Acquired: I improved my understanding of form structure, using textarea for multi-line input, grouping radio buttons for selection, and inline styling.

### Reflection 

1) What I Learned: I learned to structure HTML forms with various input types, improve accessibility with for attributes in labels, and enhance readability with inline styles.

2) Challenges Faced: I encountered syntax errors in the radio button name attributes, which made selection inconsistent. I fixed this by standardizing the name attribute across options to ensure only one selection was possible.
