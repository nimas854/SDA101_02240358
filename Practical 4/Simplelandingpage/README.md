### Simple landing 

Create a simple landing page for a fictional e-commerce site that sells tech gadgets. The page should include a navigation bar, a grid-based product listing section, and a footer.

Use semantic HTML elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> to structure your webpage.

Include a navigation bar with links to "Home", "Products", "About Us", and "Contact".

Create a product section using a grid layout to display at least 6 products with images, names, and prices.

Add a footer with links to privacy policy, terms of service, and social media icons.

Implement Responsive Design:

Use media queries to create at least two breakpoints: tablet (768px to 1023px), and desktop (1024px and above)
Use relative units (em, rem, %, vh, vw) for sizing elements where appropriate
Implement a responsive hero section at the top of the page with a background image and overlay text
