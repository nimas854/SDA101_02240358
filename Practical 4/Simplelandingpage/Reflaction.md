### Documentation 

1) Main Concepts Applied: Both HTML codes use a basic structure with headers, navigation links, and images to create a simple e-commerce website. Inline CSS styles are applied for background colors, text colors, and image formatting. The product page also includes a grid of product images with descriptions.

2) New Skills or Knowledge Acquired: I enhanced my understanding of basic webpage layout, linking multiple pages, using external CSS, and formatting elements inline for simplicity. I also learned to align images and text in a grid structure.

### Reflection 
1) What I Learned: I learned how to link pages within a website, use inline CSS for styling, and format product images into a grid layout for visual appeal.

2) Challenges Faced: I encountered incorrect attribute usage (e.g., "weidth" instead of "width") and inconsistent link paths (e.g., "page1.HTML" should be lowercase). I overcame these by reviewing and correcting the attribute names and ensuring consistency in file paths for seamless linking.
