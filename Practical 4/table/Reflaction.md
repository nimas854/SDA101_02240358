1) Main Concepts Applied: This HTML table displays basic student information, including first name, last name, student number, and grade. Inline CSS styling is applied to change the text color of specific table headers and cells.

2) New Skills or Knowledge Acquired: I practiced using <th> tags for table headers and <td> tags for table data, as well as applying inline CSS to style specific cells and headers.

## Reflection

1) What I Learned: I improved my ability to create structured tables with headers and data rows. This exercise helped me understand the use of CSS for styling specific parts of a table.

2) Challenges Faced: I initially forgot to specify width in the meta viewport tag, which caused display issues on smaller screens. I fixed this by updating the viewport setting to fit different devices. Additionally, I ensured consistent capitalization in names for uniformity.
