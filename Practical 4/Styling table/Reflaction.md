1) Main Concepts Applied: This HTML table organizes student grades for different modules and assignments, with columns for module name, assignment, marks, percentage, and grade. Each cell is styled with background colors and font colors using inline CSS.

2) New Skills or Knowledge Acquired: I learned how to structure data in a table format, applying background and text color styling, and calculating percentage and grades for a more informative display.

### Reflection

1) What I Learned: I learned to create well-organized tables with multiple columns and rows, making it easy to compare grades across subjects. I also improved my inline CSS styling skills.

2) Challenges Faced: I encountered issues with multiple style attributes on single tags, which caused styling conflicts. I resolved this by consolidating styles into one style attribute per tag. Additionally, I noticed incorrect closing tags in some rows and fixed them to ensure proper table structure.
