### Documentation 

1) Main Concepts Applied: This HTML code organizes events in an ordered list with sub-lists for event details (time and location). CSS styling is applied inline to add a hover effect to list items, changing their color to deepskyblue. An external CSS file is also linked for further styling.

2) New Skills or Knowledge Acquired: I improved my skills in structuring nested lists for organized event details and using simple inline CSS to add hover effects.

### Reflection 

1) What I Learned: I learned how to structure an event schedule with nested lists for better readability and to add basic hover effects with CSS to enhance interactivity.

2) Challenges Faced: Initially, I found the nesting of <ul> and <li> elements visually confusing. I overcame this by clearly indenting the code and verifying list structures. Additionally, I ensured consistent styling by checking the linked CSS file paths.
