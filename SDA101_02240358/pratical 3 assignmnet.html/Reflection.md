
Here's a refined version of your description and reflection:

Description:

1) I tried creating a website through image using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS.
2) Through this assignment, I learned the basics of HTML and how to use classes and styles effectively. I understood that the grid system is a key component of Tailwind CSS, though I found it challenging.
Reflection:

1) I learned that CSS plays a crucial role in HTML. I also learned the differences between using pixels (px) and percentages (%), both of which are used for positioning elements, but in different ways.
2) My biggest challenge in creating this website was working with grids. I struggled to align images from different containers in the same row. I tried various methods such as float, CSS left-right properties, and even display: inline, but I still couldn't fix it. I also searched for solutions on YouTube but didn't find a clear answer.
I hope our teacher will teach us how to solve this one day!
