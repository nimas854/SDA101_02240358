1) Main Concepts Applied:In the first code, I created a custom-styled checkbox using HTML and CSS. By manipulating the appearance property and using pseudo-elements (::before and ::after), I was able to customize the checkbox's appearance in both its unchecked and checked states, including dynamic color changes and icons.
In the second code, I created a reusable web component (user-profile) using JavaScript's class and customElements APIs. This component uses the shadow DOM for encapsulation and can display a userâ€™s name and role as provided by custom attributes.

2) New Skills or Knowledge Acquired: I learned how to use pseudo-elements to create custom checkbox designs and became familiar with JavaScript's Web Components and Shadow DOM to build isolated, reusable elements. The process also improved my understanding of dynamically updating component attributes using attributeChangedCallback.

### Reflection 

1) What I Learned: I deepened my understanding of CSS styling techniques and how to apply animations/transitions for interactive UI elements. In addition, I learned the fundamentals of web components, especially their value in creating encapsulated and reusable elements within a web application.

2) Challenges Faced: The main challenge was understanding how to effectively use pseudo-elements for styling and how toIn the checkbox styling, achieving precise alignment and responsive behavior was challenging. Adjusting transform values and experimenting with transition effects helped me get the desired look.
In the user-profile component, I encountered difficulty in managing shadow DOM styles initially. I overcame this by reviewing documentation on attaching shadowRoot styles and using observedAttributes to ensure updates on changes to custom attributes.
