1) Main Concepts Applied: The form uses HTML input elements (text, radio buttons, date, time, email, password, dropdown) for a structured seminar registration page. Form labels and placeholders enhance accessibility and usability.

2) New Skills or Knowledge Acquired: Improved understanding of form fields, radio button groups, and the use of attributes like required for validation.

### Reflection 

1) What I Learned: I learned how to create a structured HTML form with various input types and how to use for attributes in labels for better accessibility.

2) Challenges Faced: One challenge was syntax issues (misplaced commas in attributes and incorrect spelling in some labels). I resolved this by carefully reviewing and correcting the HTML syntax and ensuring consistency in label and input associations.
