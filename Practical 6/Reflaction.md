### Documentation 

1) Main Concepts Applied: In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive registration form with real-time validation for user input. The HTML provided the structure, CSS handled the styling, and JavaScript implemented validation logic to check username, email, password, and password confirmation fields.

2) New Skills or Knowledge Acquired: I gained experience with regular expressions for email and password validation and learned how to enable or disable the submit button based on validation results. I also learned to add real-time feedback by updating error messages as the user types.

### Reflection 

1) What I Learned: I understood the importance of form validation for improving user experience and preventing errors. Additionally, I learned how JavaScript can dynamically update form fields and how to use events like input to monitor and validate data in real-time.

2) Challenges Faced: Initially, I struggled with regular expressions, especially for validating passwords with specific requirements. By experimenting and researching, I was able to create a working password pattern. Another challenge was ensuring that the "Register" button only enabled when all inputs were valid, which I achieved by grouping the validation functions.
